          I take on side projects like it's my job. I have experience creating
          graphics, logos, wireframes and websites- I'm all about the visuals. I
          am an athlete, avid adventurer, feminist and a lifelong learner.
          Coding gives me the opportunity to express my creativty, while meeting
          a challenge every step of the way. This is why I choose development!
